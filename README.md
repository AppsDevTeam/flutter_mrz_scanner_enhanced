## Usage

### Import the package
Add to `pubspec.yaml`
```yaml

The plugin uses the device camera, so do not forget to provide the `NSCameraUsageDescription`. You may specify it in `Info.plist` like that:
```xml

    <string>SCANNING MRZ REQUIRE CAMERA PERMISSIONS</string>
```

### For Android
Add
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```
to `AndroidManifest.xml`

### Use the widget
Use `MRZScanner` widget:
```dart
MRZScanner(
  withOverlay: true, // optional overlay
  onControllerCreated: (controller) =>
    onControllerCreated(controller),
  )
```
Refer to `example` project for the complete app sample.
